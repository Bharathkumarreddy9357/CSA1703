% Forward Chaining Function
forward_chain :-
    % Start with known facts and try to deduce conclusions
    apply_rules.

% Apply Rules and Deduce New Facts
apply_rules :-
    rule(Disease, Symptoms),
    forall(member(Symptom, Symptoms), fact(Symptom)),
    assertz(fact(has_disease(Disease))),
    format('You may have: ~w~n', [Disease]),
    fail.  % Keep applying rules until no more can be applied

apply_rules.  % End when no more rules can be applied

% Check all known facts
check_facts :-
    fact(Fact),
    format('Fact: ~w~n', [Fact]),
    fail.

check_facts.

% Start the forward chaining process
start_forward_chaining :-
    format('Starting forward chaining...~n'),
    forward_chain.
